# Taiwan Transformer Shaking Alert Model (TT-SAM)

This study has referenced the Transformer Earthquake Alerting Model (TEAM), a deep learning earthquake early warning (EEW) framework. We optimized the model using seismic data from Taiwan to develop the Taiwan Transformer Shaking Alert Model (TT-SAM), and it could rapidly calculate the seismic intensity to provide longer warning time.

## Model Performance

We use 2016 seismic data to evaluate model performance.

Seismic intensity threshold is from Central Weather Administration.

Background color represents model predicted intensity.
